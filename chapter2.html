            <p>II. Next chapter?</p>

            <p>&quot;What's with this obsession with being a good person? We're always thrown up against weird standards. I'm no different. I also got conscripted for the army of saviours. I like to think about things. But not all things, some things are meant to be done and not thought about. For many things the thought process has already been done for us, we are simply the consumers... users. It doesn't take intelligence to question those things. I don't like things that order me to think. I live life holistic. Thinking comes naturally. There is no challenge in that. Sometimes I feel like thinking is frowned upon, but I would never use the term mind-control. That term is only used by people who do not dare to think for themselves, and act solely from their heart. It's just not that simple. Some things are meant to be thought about. The heart plays an important factor but a lot of life's challenges will hurt if you take them personally...&quot;</p>
