            <p>I. The worldly expectations, the boundaries and the burn from the sun.</p>

            <p>&quot;What's with this obsession with being a good person? We're always thrown up against weird standards. I'm no different. I also got conscripted for the army of saviours. I like to think about things. But not all things, some things are meant to be done and not thought about. For many things the thought process has already been done for us, we are simply the consumers... users. It doesn't take intelligence to question those things. I don't like things that order me to think. I live life holistic. Thinking comes naturally. There is no challenge in that. Sometimes I feel like thinking is frowned upon, but I would never use the term mind-control. That term is only used by people who do not dare to think for themselves, and act solely from their heart. It's just not that simple. Some things are meant to be thought about. The heart plays an important factor but a lot of life's challenges will hurt if you take them personally...&quot;</p>

            <p>David worships the sun. Not in a kind of religious way, he just really loves it. All love stems from the sun, he thinks.</p>

            <p>&quot;The sun is the giver and destroyer of our universe. It's not like any of us really have anything to do with what goes on beyond our own solar system. People like to look at stars and hope they affect us in some way, or give us fortune, but that's not true.&quot;</p>

            <p>The sun is pretty much where it ends for David. It's at least as far as he is willing to go in terms of things we can not physically touch.</p>

            <p>&quot;I believe there is something out there, it's just not up to me to invent what it is. Neither is it up to anyone else to continue on that logic. The people who work on space travel would probably be the first to find out. But until then it's all speculation. We all find a little bit of comfort in thinking about these things. We can assign the inexplicable to it. Infantile fantastical nonsense.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Alright, where are you going with this?&quot; Says a voice, coming from aside. It is Hieronymus. Hieronymus is tired. Tired of David, going off on a tangent. At the edge of a grey big hall they sit on little gymnastic benches. A ballet dancer is rehearsing on the pink floor.</p>

            <p>&quot;Is that her?&quot; Hieronymus looks at her. &quot;Why are we here, David?&quot;</p>

            <p>David continues reciting his ideas, seemingly ignoring Hieronymus' question.</p>

            <p>&quot;Do you believe in love, Hieronymus?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;What kind of question is that? Are you in love with her now?&quot; Hieronymus replies.</p>

            <p>&quot;In my old house I didn't even have sunlight. Now look at these great big windows. I love to sit here and soak up the rays, it's charging me.&quot; David invited Hieronymus to come look at his latest project, but David is easily distracted.</p>

            <p>&quot;Who is she?&quot; Hieronymus asks.</p>

            <p>&quot;How have you been, friend?&quot; David asks, but Hieronymus senses there is something incoherent about David's speech.</p>

            <p>&quot;I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in eternity.&quot; David is fixated on the tree outside of his window. &quot;The trees never blossom anymore. Do you remember how green the city used to be?&quot;</p>

            <p>The sun has become so strong that the natural cycles have slowed down massively. The trees seem to be edging, but it has been like that for months.</p>

            <p>&quot;We'll see it happen again.&quot; Hieronymus replies, hoping to nudge David out of the spiral he is in.</p>

            <p>&quot;You know, I've been busy lately. I want to see your reaction to it.&quot; David says. He only wears his sunrobes anymore. He now barely goes out of his house. He also looks like he has not eaten for months.</p>

            <p>&quot;You seem... weak.&quot; Hieronymus notices.</p>

            <p>&quot;This is because I only consume what is truly universal... And I'm not weak!&quot; David lifts a big book from the windowsill and flops it down in front of Hieronymus. Snippets of photographs fall out of the book. &quot;Look, that's us.&quot; David points at a photograph. &quot;The old days, huh?&quot; The two of them stare at the picture for a moment, contently reminiscing the time they used to work together.</p>

            <p>&quot;Listen, we actually don't have a lot of time.&quot; Hieronymus quietly but sternly interrupts the moment. &quot;I need to ask for a favour.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;So I've been chosen.&quot; David says laughingly.</p>

            <p>&quot;This is a sensitive topic, David. I must speak to you in private.&quot; David nods, then looks at the dancer. &quot;Come here for a second.&quot; he gestures at her with his arm. She stops and slowly approaches David at the window. She whispers something in his ear before she takes a short look at Hieronymus and leaves. David turns to Hieronymus again and says &quot;That's why I like you... you are important, like me.&quot; It has been a long time since the two last spoke to each other. They parted ways when Hieronymus was selected to be on the team of the first human inhibitors and operators of the establishment on mars.</p>

            <p>&quot;The flight leaves in 7 days. But we still need something, something that has great value. Something that will keep them faithful. I need to ask for your Cherubim statue.&quot;</p>

            <p>David prides himself with one of the few items that was imbued with what Christians consider the Lord. Hieronymus' mission is to keep faith alive in the new colony. He believes taking this relic will come with a spirit of sanctity for the operators on mars.</p>

            <p>&quot;So what, you work for the church now? A missionary?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;No David, it's not about the church. This is an ancient artefact, the people will need a connection with home, you can't imagine what it's like to never come back to earth. Think about it, we could use your help.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;So is this your project? A photo collage?&quot; Hieronymus changes the subject, hoping to keep David from thinking too much about the request.</p>

            <p>David laughs. &quot;You'd think, but no. The sun takes on many forms, it shapes. It doesn't discriminate, however big or small, we are all children of the sun. You see the dancer? That is my partner. She reminds me very much of the sun. I see light in her. You know what? She wants to be a dancer! So I'm helping her by letting her train here.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Actually the sun does discriminate, for some it comes as a blessing but for others it means drought, overheating. You can't ignore the negative impact it has.&quot; Hieronymus responds, he is a realist to say the least. Sometimes it is hard for them to agree.</p>

            <p>&quot;Life and death, Hieronymus. You are right, but you don't have to remind me.&quot; In the meanwhile David considers Hieronymus request. He had hidden the statue for a long time, since there have been many requests for it, even times it was failed to be stolen.</p>

            <p>Mist builds up outside the hall. &quot;My dreams have come back. I think it's because of the light.&quot; David says.</p>

            <p>&quot;Not for long. Soon, the smoke will cover the days. Besides, you're not high up enough to be clear of it.&quot; Hieronymus returns.</p>

            <p>&quot;I can see it, clear as day. This is how society evolved. The higher up, the clearer skies. I see where you're at. You're jumping ship, abandoning earth. Except you believe you're jumping to a bigger, more powerful ship. I think both are doomed, but I should stay on earth.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You are wrong there, neither ship is bigger or more powerful than the other. As humans we must progress, I am joining the direction outward. This can only be done by few. What we learn will progress all of mankind.&quot; &quot;A particular select few of mankind. What you say defeats your purpose. You're taking resources that could be used to save lifes. I don't think I can gift you the Cherub. It was never meant to leave the earth.&quot;</p>

            <p>Hieronymus looks at David indignantly. He stands up from the bench, reaches for his coat and looks at David one last time. &quot;Justly so. I expected no less, but what is it to not try and be defeated. I have to go now, David.&quot;</p>
